# Security Policy

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in 4.js, please report it
privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.** This gives us time to work with you
to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be
used before a patch is released.

You may submit the report in the following ways:

- Create a private security advisory on GitHub
- Contact the maintainers through official channels

Please provide the following information in your report:

- A description of the vulnerability and its impact.
- How to reproduce the issue.
- Steps to mitigate or fix the vulnerability (if known).

This project is maintained by volunteers on a reasonable-effort basis. As such,
we ask that you give us 90 days to work on a fix before public exposure.
